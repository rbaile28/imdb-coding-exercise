Movie Data Grid

You are required to load the given CSV dataset containing popular movies on IMBD between 2006 and 2016 and build an Angular app that displays the Movie data in a sortable, searchable table grid as shown in the Grid mockup.

You are required to use Angular 9. You are free to use any REST framework. [You are not supposed to build a middleware API. The CSV data can directly be staged in the Grid]

We love a modular project structure!
Your Angular app should:

    Display all the columns in the Movie info CSV into the Grid.
    The Grid should look exactly as shown in the mockup and..
        Should allow Pagination
        Inherent Searchability.
		Sort functionality in the Columns
    The First three columns on the Grid should be "Sticky"
	On Page Load Grid should only display first 5 Columns. Upon clicking the "Expansion Bar" on the rightmost, it should display rest of the columns with horizontal scroll.
	

You can find the dataset & mockup with the repository (IMDB-Movie-Data.csv & Movie-Grid-Mockup.png). 

    We are looking for a working app. As soon as you submit, this solution will be run through our CI/CD pipeline.
    We love frequent code check-ins. We will not evaluate your code until you tell us but that should not stop you from making periodic check-ins.
    Include instructions on how to setup your application.
    A README would be great!
    We like unit tests!
    We love easy to read/debug code (think modularization). Be open to discuss your design approach.

Estimated Time For Implementation: 1 day

Mode of Submission: You will be provided a link to this repository. Create a feature branch & implement the solution on the branch.

If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Good luck!
